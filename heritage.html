                <h4><br><b>My Dad's Family</b></h4>
                <p>
                I come from a diverse family, with roots primarily
                in Mexican and Irish culture. I am only a quarter 
                Mexican and half Irish. My father is half Mexican 
                and half Irish. His mother, my abuelita, was the 
                daughter of Mexican immigrants, specifically from
                the Guadalajara region. My abuelita was one of 17 
                and resided on the south east side of Chicago. Her
                family, The Castro Family, had an exhibit at the 
                Mexican Museum of Art at one point.

                On the other side, my dad’s dad, my poppy, was the
                son of Irish immigrants. My poppy’s father, my 
                great-grandfather, was Tommie Ryan. He was an 
                Irishman who was part of the IRA and labeled as a 
                terrorist under the British. He blew up bridges and
                knocked down trees to support the Irish against 
                the Brits. He was arrested, and at a jail camp, he
                became close with the soon to be Prime Minister of 
                Irealnd. He was then kicked out of the country 
                after a failed escape attempt. On the ship to 
                America, he met his soon to be wife. They settled 
                on the west side of Chicago where Tommie Ryan 
                became an Irish Political Activist. He started 
                the Shannon Rovers Irish Bagpipe Band and became 
                close with Richard Daley. Wherever Richard Daley 
                went, the Shannon Rovers played. Tommie Ryan also 
                started the St. Patrick’s parade downtown, where my
                great uncle still announces it.

                Now onto my mama’s parents. My mama’s mother, 
                my grandma, is the daughter of European immigrants,
                one of which was Jewish. They resided on the West 
                Side, in Austin. My grandma and her sisters actually 
                all attended Austin Highschool. My mama’s father, my 
                grandpa, has an established lineage in Alabama where 
                he was born. He is of both Scotch Irish and Native 
                American heritage.
